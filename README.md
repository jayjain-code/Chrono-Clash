# Chrono Clash ⏳⚔️

**Chrono Clash** is a turn-based tactical strategy game where battles unfold across **three timelines simultaneously** — **Past, Present, and Future**.

Positioning, timing, and causality matter.  
What you do in the past can decide who survives in the future.

*(Best played on desktop, fully playable on mobile)*

## 🧠 Core Concept

- The battlefield exists in **three timelines**
- Units can **time-shift** between timelines
- Buffs and debuffs propagate forward in time
- Victory is achieved by destroying the enemy **Chronosphere** in the Present

## ⏱️ How to Play (Quick Rules)

- **2 Players (Local / Pass & Play)**
- Each turn: **3 Action Points (AP)**  
- Actions:
  - **Move** – 1 AP  
  - **Attack** – 1 AP  
  - **Time Shift** – 2 AP (0 AP for Walker units)

### Timeline Effects
- **Past** → Grants **Attack Buffs** to future units  
- **Present** → Main combat zone & objective  
- **Future** → Units may gain **Defense Buffs**, but risk decay

## 🧩 Units

- **Guardian** – Tanky frontline unit  
- **Striker** – High damage, low HP  
- **Walker** – Can shift timelines for free  
- **Chronosphere** – Base objective (destroy to win)

## 🎯 Design Goals
